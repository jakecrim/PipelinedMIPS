# PipelinedMIPS
- This program simulates the functionality of a processor running MIPS assembly instructions. An input file containing a program entirely written in MIPS is the input,and the C program 'mu-mips.c' will run through the MIPS assembly instructions simulating their functionality.
- Not only does it simulate each instruction, it also simulates a 4 stage pipeline. Meaning it has to handle the data hazards and branch/jump predictions that come along with pipelining.
- Usage:
    - run the executable with a `*.in` file as the argument, then follow on screen instructions for simulating the program.
        - ex: `./mu-mips testHazards.in` 
    - Program supports:
        - full program simulation
        - running for single or specified number of CPU cycles at a time
        - register dump
        - memory dump
        - 'show' to show the contents of the pipelined registers.
